            <p>Santorini, known since ancient times as Thira, is one of the most famous islands in the world. The fact
              that you can sit in front of the caldera, enjoy local dishes, a drink or a coffee while gazing at the
              remarkable beauty of an active volcano is priceless!</p>

            <p>One of the top things to do in Grand Cayman is swimming with sea creatures at Stingray City. This
              shallow, sandy area, about 25 miles offshore, is filled with gentle Atlantic stingrays that you can touch
              and even kiss.</p>

            <p>Craving a travel adventure focused on nature and wildlife? You can't go wrong with a trip to Costa Rica
              in May. It's only the very beginning of the rainy season, so while you are likely to have some chance of
              showers, you'll get much better prices for weather that's almost as nice as it is earlier in the year.</p>

            <p>May is one of your last chances to visit the "Big Easy" before the city becomes infamously muggy for the
              summer, and fortunately, it's also one of the cheapest times to visit New Orleans. Your best bet is to
              plan your trip to New Orleans during the week, if you're looking to save some money. Expect warm days,
              breezy nights, and plenty of Creole culture.</p>

            <p>Even on a short itinerary, tourists can experience many of Istanbul's top-rated tourist attractions in
              May, as the entry lines should be relatively short. Visit the Aya Sofya, the 1,500-year-old
              church-turned-mosque, arguably the most recognizable landmark in the city.</p>

            <p>Aside from the occasional shower or two, Cancun has fantastic weather in May. The spring breakers have
              returned home, and resorts are eager to fill their rooms, dropping their prices to ultra-low rates. It'll
              be hot, but with Cancun's breezy, uncrowded coastline and breathtakingly clear sea, you won't sweat it.
